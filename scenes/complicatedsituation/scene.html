    <strong>The failure</strong> of the postcolonial elites to <strong>create genuine democratic societies</strong> and foster a sense of national unity <strong>opting instead for military dictatorships</strong> that <strong>eroded the potential for economic and political development</strong> coupled with the historic mistakes of Arabic progressive parties and their <strong>appeasement towards autocratic rulers</strong> contributing to the <strong>complete evisceration of alternative political frameworks</strong> that could create organic resistance towards external meddling, hegemony and outright military interventions leaving a <strong>radical interpretation of religion as the only remaining ideological platform capable of mobilising the disenfranchised</strong> exacerbated by the global decline of universal ideals and the <strong>rise of identity as a prime mobiliser</strong> and enabled by political and <strong>financial support from theocratic regimes</strong> aiming to shore up their legitimacy and made worse by the <strong>collapse of the regional security</strong> order creating the conditions for <strong>proxy wars</strong> and political, social and economic upheaval intensified by geo-politically <strong>incoherent international meddling</strong> escalating conflicts and leading to a <strong>perpetual state of chaos</strong> under which the appeal of a revivalist religious-political order embodied by the <strong>caliphate becomes attractive</strong> particularly when coupled with a millenarian apocalyptic narrative.
